# Vue 3 Dropdown (Single + Multiselect)

Single and Multiselect components with capabilities of clearing, deleting, and passing in a set of options to present for the dropdowns

# Data & props

- The only prop you need to pass through is the options you want to present in the dropdown.
- The data is currently passed from component to parent via emit events. Another alternative can be to use a vue store.
